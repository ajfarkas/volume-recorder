A web application for recording audio volume and looking for patterns.

`$ node server` starts the server on port 8001. Access the application in the browser at http://localhost:8001

You have to interact with the window before the Audio Context can commence, so the there's a fullscreen button to click, then you'll get asked for microphone access.
